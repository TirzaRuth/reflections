    Helps easily revert changes in case of errors. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    You can do trial version in the same file and can commit after you are done with changes. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Not too sure but maybe several files are reference a master file so changing the master file might require other changes to the references.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
